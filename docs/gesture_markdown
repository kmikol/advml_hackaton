# Tiny On-Device Gesture Classifier (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense)

A minimal end-to-end demo that trains a tiny sequence classifier on 4-gesture tokens and runs it **fully on-device** on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (APDS-9960 gesture sensor). Python trains a multinomial logistic regression and exports `model_weights.h`; the Arduino sketch buffers 4 gestures, runs `WÂ·x+b`, and lights an RGB LED for the predicted class.

> **Data management note:** because the APDS-9960 provides only **UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**, this project ships with a **synthetic dataset** (length-4 sequences) plus a clean switch to load real, logged CSV later.
